The term web map typically refers to a map embedded in a webpage. The map allows the user to interact with the data in some way. Often, the user can pan and zoom to adjust the view and click on data markers to learn more information about a location. 1.2 Why make a web map? Web maps can be a powerful way to share spatial information with other people, especially when you expect the viewer to want to explore the data in different ways. Web maps allow the user to customize their experience in ways that a static map cannot. Because of the interactivity, they can be a more engaging way for your audience to learn about a topic of interest. Web maps can also be a way to interact with a community of interest, enabling a researcher to both share and collect spatial information from a community. 1.3 Examples Examples of informative and engaging web maps abound on the internet. Here are a few examples that make use of Leaflet, the javascript library well be working with today: UC Davis Potential COVID Workplace Exposures Map - UC Davis datalab California Beach Plant Species Distributions - Michele Tobias 1.4 Workflow At first glace, building a web map might seem daunting, but well take it one step at a time and build up to an engaging demonstration of what web maps can do. To make an online interactive web map, well need to complete several steps. Typically these steps include: Make a webpage to contain the web map code (coding in HTML) Write the web map code and put it into the webpage (coding in javascript) Put the web page online 1.5 Leaflet In todays workshop, well be using a javascript library called Leaflet to write the code that will make our web map. Leaflet is a popular open source javascript library specifically designed to build interactive web maps with a combination of data available online (like tile services for basemaps) and your own data. Leaflet is well-documented and has excellent tutorials to illustrate common tasks and innovative uses of the tool. In addition, there is an active community using this tool so there is ample support on online message boards and social media outlets. 1.6 Workshop Data: UC Davis Campus Cats In todays workshop, well be working with the UC Davis Campus Cats data set that was originally compiled by Rachel Bingham and Rachel Hale at the UC Davis Office of Educational Opportunity &amp; Enrichment Services to facilitate the Campus Cat Safari Connection through the First Year Aggie Connection program. This data was downloaded from Rachel &amp; Rachels Google Map on 2021-10-14 and this data is used with permission from the authors. For this workshop, DataLab staff have processed the data from its original KML format to create a .geojson file embedded in a javascript file (more details on this process and why we did it to come). "],["setting-up-your-file-structure.html", "2 Setting Up Your File Structure 2.1 Download the Data 2.2 Folders 2.3 Files", " 2 Setting Up Your File Structure Before we do any coding, lets set up our file and folder structure. 2.1 Download the Data The data for the workshop is available to download from this box drive. You can download the file itself or click the download button in the upper right corner of the screen. (You may need to dismiss a message about logging in to see the button, but you do not need to log in to download the data.) Save the file to a folder on your computer that you can find. If the file you downloaded is a .zip file, unzip the file. The data for this workshop is one javascript file called campus_cats.js 2.2 Folders Using your computers file browsing program, navigate to a folder you want to work in. In that folder, create a new folder to hold your files for this project, such as my_web_map. Inside that folder, create another folder called docs. the docs folder will hold the HTML and javascript files that will create our web map. Your folder structure should now look like this: my_web_map |-- docs 2.3 Files Move the data you downloaded for this workshop called campus_cats.js into the data folder. Open your preferred text editor application. Create a new, blank file. Save it inside your docs folder and call it index.html. This will be the homepage for our web site that will hold our web map. Your folder and file structure should now look like this: my_web_map |-- docs | |-- campus_cats.js | |-- index.htm "],["build-a-webpage.html", "3 Build a Webpage 3.1 Intro to HTML 3.2 Start Building your Webpage", " 3 Build a Webpage The first step in building a web map is to make a basic webpage to house our map. It doesnt need to be elaborate to get started, but we do need to understand some concepts. 3.1 Intro to HTML HTML stands for hypertext markup language. If youve ever used R Markdown or GitHub Markdown or worked in a Jupiter Notebook, youll notice some similarities, but probably more differences. The key thing to understand about HTML is that every element (text, code, images, etc.) you put into your code needs to be labeled to tell the web browser how to render that element. We label the elements with a tag. We label the start of an element with an opening tag, such as &lt;p&gt; to start a paragraph, and end it with a closing tag, such as &lt;/p&gt;. Some tags are special and dont need to be closed, such as a line break &lt;br&gt;, but those are rare. For example: &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is text in a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; There are tags for many types of elements. W3Schools lists them alphabetically in their HTML Element Reference. Well learn a few of the common tags as we build our webpage. 3.2 Start Building your Webpage Open the index.html file (its in the docs folder) in a text editor. Using a text editor with syntax highlighting can be helpful, but isnt mandatory. Since we just created it, the file is blank. Well add some code to get started. The first, we need to indicate that our text file contains HTML, and then place opening and closing tags to indicate which part of the document contains HTML. Well write our webpage code between those HTML tags. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Weve made a blank webpage! Now, lets add something more interesting to it. The beginning of the HTML document is where you normally place the parameters and settings that make the webpage work. Well add a section called head to our page to contain some of these parameters. Inside of the head section, well indicate the title of our webpage, wrapped in &lt;title&gt; tags. This puts the name of the webpage in the tab at the top of the browser. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;/html&gt; If you open your index.html file in your web browser, youll have a blank page with a tab called UC Davis Campus Cats Map. The body section of a web page contains the code that appears on the actual web page. Well add a body section and some information. Note that &lt;h1&gt; makes a heading and &lt;p&gt; makes a paragraph. &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This webmap shows the locations of UC Davis campus community cats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Reload your index.html document in your browser to see your new text. You have now written a short but very legitimate HTML webpage! We could certainly write more text, but for the sake of demonstration, well keep it short for now. In the next section, well build the code that makes our web map. "],["build-a-leaflet-web-map.html", "4 Build a Leaflet Web Map 4.1 Prepare Your Page 4.2 Add A Map 4.3 Use External Data 4.4 Add a popup 4.5 Put Your Web Page online", " 4 Build a Leaflet Web Map Now that weve made a basic webpage, we can add our web map. 4.1 Prepare Your Page 4.1.1 Load The External Files In the head section of our webpage, we need to add some information that will tell our map how to appear (the CSS file) and where to find the Leaflet package (Leaflet JavaScript file). CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. You can think of this as the parameters that set the way certain objects are displayed in a website. The file well load specifically styles the map elements made with Leaflet. Loading the Leaflet JavaScript file enables our webpage to have access to the functions and tools in the Leaflet Library. For R or Python users, this is similar to loading packages or libraries in your code. We could save a static version of this library in our website folders and point to that, or we can link to an online version of it, like we have done in the code below. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!--Load the Leaflet CSS file --&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A==&quot;crossorigin=&quot;&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--Load the Leaflet JavaScript file --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA==&quot;crossorigin=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This webmap shows the locations of UC Davis campus community cats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Note that in HTML, comments are written like this: &lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;. Comments are information for the coder and dont render on the website. The code we just added doesnt make any visible changes on our website so if you reload your web page, you wont notice anything new, but it should load. If it has an error or the text doesnt show up, youll need to debug your code. 4.1.2 Add a Map Div A &lt;div&gt; element defines a section in your HTML document. Our web map needs its own &lt;div&gt;. Well add one inside the &lt;body&gt; of the webpage. Note that the &lt;div&gt; has an ID. This will let us create settings and code that apply to this specific &lt;div&gt;. We can define the style of the &lt;div&gt; inside the tag (as we have done below) or we could do it in the &lt;head&gt; of the document in a &lt;style&gt; subsection, or in a separate CSS file. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!--Load the Leaflet CSS file --&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A==&quot;crossorigin=&quot;&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--Load the Leaflet JavaScript file --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA==&quot;crossorigin=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This webmap shows the locations of UC Davis campus community cats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;mapid&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; If you reload your index.html file in your browser, you shouldnt notice any difference. If the page doesnt load, however, youll need to troubleshoot your code. Make sure your tags open and close in the right order. 4.1.3 Add a Script Section Finally, we need to add a section to our code to hold the Leaflet JavaScript code we will write to make our map. Just below your map &lt;div&gt; (and inside the body section), add open and closed &lt;script&gt; tags. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!--Load the Leaflet CSS file --&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A==&quot;crossorigin=&quot;&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--Load the Leaflet JavaScript file --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA==&quot;crossorigin=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;UC Davis Campus Cats Map&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This webmap shows the locations of UC Davis campus community cats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;mapid&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; 4.2 Add A Map Now were ready to add a map. Well make a simple one to start and add more data later. Note: from now on, well be working in the &lt;script&gt; section, so the code will just show this section to avoid clutter and focus on whats changing in the code. Inside the &lt;script&gt; section, well now be writing javascript. // is how you indicate a comment in JavaScript. Outside of this section, youll be writing HTML. It can get confusing sometimes, so have patience with yourself. First, well create an empty map in our mapid div, then well load Stamens Toner tile service to use as a background layer. The limited color palette of the Toner tile service will make it easier to see the data well be loading later. &lt;script&gt; //add an empty map called &quot;catmap&quot; to the page in the mapid div var catmap = L.map(&#39;mapid&#39;, { center: [38.538592, -121.75], zoom: 15 }); //add the base map = Stamen Toner tile layer var Stamen_Toner = L.tileLayer(&#39;https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.{ext}&#39;, { attribution: &#39;Map tiles by &lt;a href=&quot;http://stamen.com&quot;&gt;Stamen Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0&quot;&gt;CC BY 3.0&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; Map data &amp;copy; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;&#39;, subdomains: &#39;abcd&#39;, minZoom: 0, maxZoom: 20, ext: &#39;png&#39; }); catmap.addLayer(Stamen_Toner); &lt;/script&gt; Your web page should now have a map with Stamens Toner tile layer. It should look something like this: Well add some of our own data to the map next. 4.2.1 Add a Marker Lets add a marker so we can find the Quad. The marker will be a blue inverted teardrop that will have a tooltip that says Quad when you hover over it. At the end of your script section, add: //add a marker for the Quad with a tooltip //Quad: 38.541162, -121.749371 var marker = new L.marker([38.541112, -121.749350], { opacity: 1.0 //teardrop marker opacity may be set to zero }); marker.bindTooltip(&quot;&lt;b&gt;Quad&lt;b&gt;&quot;, { }); marker.addTo(catmap); You now have an interactive map with one marker! Notice the order of the code: we first define the marker, then add the tooltip to the marker, and finally we have to add the marker to the map. Defining, adding specifications, then adding an item to the map is a pretty common workflow in Leaflet. 4.3 Use External Data Adding markers by hand is great, but if we have a lot of data? Or what if our data is more complex than a few points to add? What if we want to prepare our data in a GIS or with a script ahead of time? If any of these situations apply to the work we want to do, we probably want to load data from a data file, not writing it out in the code. There are many methods to load an external data file in Leaflet. Well look at just one here, but there are ways to work with any of the common file types. Here, well use data in geoJSON format. 4.3.1 About GeoJSON GeoJSON is a spatial data format based on the JSON format. Because it is text-based, it is human-readable, however, depending on the complexity of the data, you may not want to try to read it in a text editor. Another advantage of using a text-based format is that it can easily be stored in online version control systems like GitHub, as long as a file size isnt too big. This is a nice feature if you want to host your webmap on GitHub Pages. Any of the major GIS tools or programming languages can convert vector data to GeoJSON format. 4.3.2 Formatting the Data Leaflet cant read GeoJSON directly, but to make it work, all we have to do is open the .geojson file in a text editor, add var varable-name = { at the beginning of the file, and } at the end of the file (were wrapping the data in a variable declaration). Then we save the file with a .js extension (because what weve actually done is written a small JavaScript file). Weve done this for you to create the campus_cats.js file, declaring our variable as campus_cats. You can see the GeoJSON structure and the variable declaration if you open the file in a text editor. 4.3.3 Read the Data To read the data into our webpage, we need to add another short script section, just above the one weve been working in that calls our campus_cats.js data file. &lt;script src=&quot;campus_cats.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Now the data in this file will be available to load into our map. 4.3.4 Add Data to the Map This is the moment youve been waiting for! Well add data from our external data file to the map. Add this code to the bottom of your long script section (below where we made our marker for the Quad and above the closing &lt;/script&gt; tag): //add cat points from the GeoJSON (campus_cats.js) file var catpoints = L.geoJSON(campus_cats, { pointToLayer: function(feature, latlng){ return L.circleMarker(latlng, {color: &#39;orange&#39;, radius: 8}); } }).addTo(catmap); We now have many orange circles for our cats (and one for the quad that we added earlier)! What does this code do though? First, we create a variable called catpoints using the geojson data which we named campus_cats inside the .js file. Then we create a function called pointToLayer that uses the parameters feature (each row in the data) and latlng (the geometry) from the geojson data. We make a circleMarker using the latlng variable for the position, and use the style options between the {}s to style the marker the way we want it. In this case, its orange and has a radius of 8 (which is a little smaller than the default). Finally, we add the entire set of markers we built to the map (remember that we called our div that holds our map catmap). 4.4 Add a popup It would be nice to have some information available for each marker. Lets make a popup that tells us about each cat. Well start with a text popup and gradually add more to it. We made our markers for our point locations by iterating over the list of features in our dataset and making a marker for each of them. We can add a function to the one we already have so that once the markers get made, each will get a popup. Well modify our code that adds our points to look like this: //add cat points from the GeoJSON (campus_cats.js) file var catpoints = L.geoJSON(campus_cats, { pointToLayer: function(feature, latlng){ return L.circleMarker(latlng, {color: &#39;orange&#39;, radius: 8}); }, onEachFeature: function(feature, layer){ layer.bindPopup(&quot;This is a popup!&quot;); } }).addTo(catmap); What did we do? After the pointToLayer function, we added a new created a new function called OnEachFeature that uses the feature (each row of the data) and the layer information. For each feature, we have it bind a popup to our layer (named catpoints) and put the text that is in the parentheses into the popup. For now, all of our popups will say This is a popup!. Well build on that next. 4.4.1 Customize Popup Text with Data This is progress! We have a map with points and popups that contain placeholder text. Lets use the attribute data from our catpoints layer to add the name of each cat to the popup. Instead of the This is a popup! text, we can use the attribute data from our catpoints data. Replace the current This is a popup! text with: feature.properties.Name (with no quotes around it). As we loop through each row of our data, the code will add each cats name to the popup. What if we want to give the popup more context? The text for the popup can be plain text, but we can also use HTML to style the text like a very small webpage. (If your head is starting to spin from switching languages HTML page containing JavaScript containing HTML this is normal.) Well start small and build up to something more complex. Maybe we want to indicate that the text in the popup is the name of the cat. We can concatenate (paste together) some text with HTML styling with our code to get the cat names: \"&lt;b&gt;Name: &lt;/b&gt;\" + feature.properties.Name Our popups are starting to be much more useful! Ready to get a little more complex? Lets add a description of the cat. We can use &lt;br&gt; to create a line break and put text onto a new line: \"&lt;b&gt;Name: &lt;/b&gt;\" + feature.properties.Name + \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description: &lt;/b&gt;\"+ feature.properties.details This gets harder to read the longer it gets, so sometimes it helps to write the HTML pieces on separate lines, and once youre ready to run it, put all the text onto one line. The text portion of our popup text needs to be wrapped in quotation marks but the calls for the data should not be. In our data, we have a column that has a link to a picture of each cat. Lets put the cats picture at the top of the popup. The &lt;img&gt; tag will add an image to our popup. \"&lt;img src='\"+feature.properties.gx_media_links+\"' width='259'&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name: &lt;/b&gt;\" + feature.properties.Name + \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description: &lt;/b&gt;\"+ feature.properties.details Heres what the section of our code that adds the catpoints marker should now look like: //add cat points from the GeoJSON (campus_cats.js) file var catpoints = L.geoJSON(campus_cats, { pointToLayer: function(feature, latlng){ return L.circleMarker(latlng, {color: &#39;orange&#39;, radius: 8}); }, onEachFeature: function(feature, layer){ layer.bindPopup( &quot;&lt;img src=&#39;&quot;+feature.properties.gx_media_links+&quot;&#39; width=&#39;259&#39;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Name: &lt;/b&gt;&quot; + feature.properties.Name + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description: &lt;/b&gt;&quot;+ feature.properties.details); } }).addTo(catmap); And here is our we bmap: 4.5 Put Your Web Page online There are many options to put your web page online so others can see and interact with it. At the heart of the task is moving your docs folder to an online server and having some way to host the website. One option that is free of cost and well-documented is to use GitHub Pages (see the instructions for a project site).
